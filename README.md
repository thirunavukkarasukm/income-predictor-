# Income-Prediction-Web-App-using-Flask

In this repository, you can find an ML model deployed on a Web App using Flask. I have trained a machine learning model using the Decision Tree algorithm because it is easy to use, resilient and flexible. which helps to predict the income based on input data:
Age, Work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, gender, capital gain, capital loss, work hours per week, and native country.
To create this Web App follow the steps given below:
 

1. Create a virtual environment.
    1. mkdir income-prediction
    2. cd income-prediction
    3. python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment.
    1. source venv/bin/activate
    
3. Install Flask.
    1. pip install flask
    
4. We have to install many required libraries which will be used in this model. Use the pip command to install all the libraries. Install libraries- pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
    1. pip install pandas
    2. pip install numpy
    3. pip install sklearn
    
5. Create folder templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will display in the userâ€™s browser. This folder contains our Html form file index.html.Further, refer to folder structure to create static folder and python files.
    1. mkdir templates

6. Now, you are ready to train the model using the given dataset. Create Html files that structure your website.
